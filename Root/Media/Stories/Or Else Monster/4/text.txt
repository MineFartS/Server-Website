When the two monsters met, the Or What Monster told the Or Else Monster that he looked like a before picture, and as soon as this insult registered, he started beating the Or What Monster with his bat.

He began his mission to spread hatred, bitterness, and agony across the world, at a rate faster than the Or Else Monster can handle.
